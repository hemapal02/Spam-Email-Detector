I'll create a frontend web application that implements your spam detection model. This will be an interactive email classifier that users can test with their own email content.I've created a modern, interactive frontend for your spam detection model! Here's what the application includes:

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features:

**Visual Design:**
- Modern gradient backgrounds with animated elements
- Glassmorphism effects and smooth animations
- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Professional color scheme with visual feedback

**Functionality:**
- Text area for entering email content
- Real-time spam detection simulation
- Pre-loaded example emails (both spam and legitimate)
- Confidence scoring system
- Model performance statistics display

**User Experience:**
- Smooth hover effects and button animations
- Loading states during analysis
- Clear visual distinction between spam and legitimate emails
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Enter to analyze)

## ðŸ’¡ How it Works:

The frontend simulates your machine learning model by using:
- **Keyword analysis** similar to TF-IDF feature extraction
- **Scoring algorithm** that mimics logistic regression decision-making
- **Pattern recognition** for common spam indicators

## ðŸš€ Example Emails Included:

1. **Spam Examples**: Prize winners, financial scams
2. **Legitimate Examples**: Business meetings, family communications

The interface provides immediate visual feedback with color-coded results, confidence percentages, and engaging animations that make the spam detection process interactive and informative.

You can easily integrate this with your actual Python model by replacing the JavaScript detection logic with API calls to your trained model!
